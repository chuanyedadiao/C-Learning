WHEN DAY IS DONE

IF THE DAY IS DONE ,
IF BIRDS SING NO MORE .
IF THE WIND HAS FIAGGED TIRED ,
THEN DRAW THE VEIL OF DARKNESS THICK UPON ME ,
EVEN AS THOU HAST WRAPT THE EARTH WITH THE COVERLET OF SLEEP AND TENDERLY CLOSED ,
THE PETALS OF THE DROOPING LOTUS AT DUSK.
FROM THE TRAVERER,
WHOSE SACK OF PROVISIONS IS EMPTY BEFORE THE VOYAGE IS ENDED ,
WHOSE GARMENT IS TORN AND DUST-LADEN ,
WHOSE STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED,REMOVE SHAME AND POVERTY ,
AND RENEW HIS LIFE LIKE A FLOWER UNDER
THE COVER OF THY KINDLY NIGHT .
